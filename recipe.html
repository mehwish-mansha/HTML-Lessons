    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces (230g) dry spaghetti</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>3 large cloves garlic, minced or thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Red chili flakes to taste (optional, for heat)</li>
      <li>Grated Parmesan cheese for serving (optional) </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until it is al dente (tender yet firm).</li><br>
      <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, warm the olive oil in a large skillet or pan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook gently until it is fragrant and lightly golden, being careful not to burn it. If using, add the red chili flakes now.
</li><br>
      <li><strong>Combine the pasta and sauce:</strong> Before draining the pasta, scoop out and reserve about 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water. Drain the spaghetti and add it directly to the skillet with the garlic and oil mixture.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Finish the dish:</strong> Toss the pasta around so it is well coated with the oil. Add a splash of the reserved pasta water if needed to help the sauce emulsify and cling to the noodles.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Season and serve:</strong> Stir in the fresh parsley (if using) and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Serve immediately, topped with Parmesan cheese if desired. </li>
    </ol>
